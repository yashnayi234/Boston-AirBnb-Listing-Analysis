### Project Motivation

This project is focused on analyzing Airbnb listing data for Boston, inspired by a previous analysis of Seattle Airbnb data. The goal is to gain insights into various aspects of Airbnb listings in Boston, such as pricing, occupancy rates, and influential features for predicting listing prices.

This project answers the following key questions:
1. **How do pricing and occupancy rates vary among different Airbnb listings in Boston?**
2. **How does the number of amenities vary based on the price of different Airbnb listings?**
3. **Which locations have higher booking ratios over time and generate more revenue?**
4. **What are the most influential features affecting the price of Airbnb listings?**

### Libraries
This project uses Python for data analysis and visualization. The following libraries were used in the Jupyter Notebook:
1. `numpy` - For numerical operations
2. `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis
3. `matplotlib.pyplot` - For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
4. `seaborn` - For statistical data visualization
5. `sklearn` - For machine learning and data preprocessing
6. `collections` - For specialized container datatypes
7. `math` - For mathematical operations
