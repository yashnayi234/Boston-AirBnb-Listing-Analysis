### Project Motivation

This project is focused on analyzing Airbnb listing data for Boston, inspired by a previous analysis of Seattle Airbnb data. The goal is to gain insights into various aspects of Airbnb listings in Boston, such as pricing, occupancy rates, and influential features for predicting listing prices.

This project answers the following key questions:
1. **How do pricing and occupancy rates vary among different Airbnb listings in Boston?**
2. **How does the number of amenities vary based on the price of different Airbnb listings?**
3. **Which locations have higher booking ratios over time and generate more revenue?**
4. **What are the most influential features affecting the price of Airbnb listings?**

### Libraries
This project uses Python for data analysis and visualization. The following libraries were used in the Jupyter Notebook:
1. `numpy` - For numerical operations
2. `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis
3. `matplotlib.pyplot` - For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
4. `seaborn` - For statistical data visualization
5. `sklearn` - For machine learning and data preprocessing
6. `collections` - For specialized container datatypes
7. `math` - For mathematical operations

### File Descriptions
1. **Boston-AirBnb-Listing-Analysis.ipynb**
   - Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, answers to the questions, explanations, and visualizations.

2. **listings.csv**
   - The original dataset is in CSV format and contains information about Airbnb listings in Boston.
  
3. **requirements.txt**
   - This code runs on Python version 3.*. Also, a list of required libraries and their versions.

### Summary of Results

Pricing and Occupancy Rates: The analysis revealed that pricing and occupancy rates vary significantly across different neighborhoods in Boston. Listings in downtown areas tend to have higher prices and higher occupancy rates.

Amenities and Price: A positive correlation exists between the number of amenities and the listing price. Listings with more amenities tend to be priced higher.

Booking Ratios and Revenue: Neighborhoods such as Back Bay and Beacon Hill have higher booking ratios and generate more revenue compared to other areas.

Influential Features: Features such as location, number of amenities, property type, and review scores are the most influential factors affecting the price of Airbnb listings.
